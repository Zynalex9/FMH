It is food on the table, clean clothes, warmth in winter, and dignity in every moment.\n\nFounded in Little Rock, Arkansas, by Sy’Viceeaa Hall, FMH began as a small outreach effort helping families who were slipping through the cracks — the working mothers skipping meals so their children could eat, seniors choosing between medication and heating, and unhoused neighbors often overlooked.\n\nWhat started as personal deliveries of food and hygiene items grew into a structured, community-based system built on three words: Deliver. Restore. Daily. These words became more than a tagline — they became a model of compassion in action.\n\nToday, FMH supports hundreds of Arkansans through food access, hygiene kits, educational supplies, and the annual “Warm Hands = Warm Hearts” Winter Initiative. As FMH expands, it aims to reach thousands, restoring hope one delivery at a time.",
